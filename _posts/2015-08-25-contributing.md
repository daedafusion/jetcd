The first step in contributing to the code base is [forking the repo](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo).

If you have an existing fork, make the repo is up-to-date. Always create the
branch off the actively developed branch (typically `develop` or `master`)

**For bug fixes:**

- Create a branch
- Once the bug has been fixed with sufficient testing submit a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests)
- If there is an existing open issue, reference the issue number in the pull request description.

**For new features:**

Open a ticket thoroughly describing the feature. The more detail you provide, the better. After at least one of core developers responds or triages the ticket and says it's a go, follow the steps:

- Create a branch
- Once implemented with tests and documentation, submit a pull request
referencing the open ticket.

**For documentation:**

- Create a branch or [edit the file](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-and-editing-files-in-your-repository#changing-files-you-dont-own)
- Submit a pull request
